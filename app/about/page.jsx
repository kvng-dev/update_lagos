              Here is a couple of our dreams and aspirations we aim to achieve
              with our project:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-decimal px-8 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Grants & Loans to Students with verified identities to help with
                tuition, accommodation and other living costs in our community.
              </li>
              <li>
                Income & Student Finance Support programs, that partner with
                businesses and companies that understand our dreams for
                students, with massive discounts and offers, redeemable at
                retail shops upon presentation of the Studentâ€™s ID Card.
                Students should be able to have a wide range of discounts on
                travel, food, entertainment and retail.
              </li>
              <li>
                Employment and Support Allowance for students with disabilities.
                The disabled will not be left out, as every Lagos child retains
                the right to get proper education, without limitations due to
                their physical disabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Housing benefits: Many universities in Lagos offer on-campus
                accommodation. These can be made even more affordable at
                subsidized rates, cheap enough and convenient for Students to
                benefit from.
              </li>
              <li>
                Health Care: Students should be able to have access to free
                healthcare services, especially students from low-income
                backgrounds. Students should be able to apply for help with
                healthcare costs, such as prescriptions, dental care, eye care,
                etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Public transport Discounts: Students should be able to benefit
                from discounted travels, and trips within the state, with
                reduced fares upon presentation of a Student ID card from any of
                the institutions in Lagos State. These benefits contribute to a
                supportive environment that enhances both the academic and
                personal development of students in Lagos State. These are our
                aims and goals we hope to achieve.
